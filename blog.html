            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="">Full Release! v.1.0.001</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">14th February 2024</h6> <br>
            What a journey it has been. Full of tears, sweat, and death. Actually, no death. But just like Alexander brought his army from one end of the world to another, we too, have brought AlexanderBall to full release! That’s right! It’s here, baby! The grand conclusion to the grand odyssey is here! Thank you so much for your patience, love, and support! Don’t worry, there will still be a couple of updates here and there… we have a responsibility. So, without further ado - <p></p>

            <b>Improvements:</b><br>
            - Two brand new regions have been added to the game including one where no soldiers can be recruited upon entering. Good luck! <br>
            - The rest of the story is here! <br>
            - Two new enemy commanders - Porus and Taxiles (he was definitely not actually named Taxiles) <br>
            - You ever wondered how difficult it must be to manage an empire the size of Alexander’s? Well, now you can deal with it in our brand new Final Empire Management UI. Your choices at the end of the campaign will determine whether Alexander dies young like in the real history, or if he manages to live a long, prosperous life. <br>
            - You know, you can play this game multiple times. With very different armies. And we will now record all their heroisms in the Hall of Fame! <br>
            - A sexy new tile highlight has been added when you are in the process of setting up your formation. <br>
            - A bunch of achievements have undergone balancing. Some were almost impossible without these changes. <br>
            - Enjoy a lovely set of alt-history cutscenes at the end of the game that depend on your answers to the Final Empire Management problem! <p></p>
            
            <b>Fixes:</b> <br> 
            - An issue with the badges that indicate the level of a unit has been fixed. <br>
            - Grammatical fixes have been implemented throughout the story and random events. <br>
            - Parmenion was still available after he died in the story. He has been sent to the realm of Hades. <br>
            - A couple of arrows in a couple of the regions were bouncing when they were not supposed to be bouncing. That has been fixed. <br>
            - The impact of different diplomatic actions have been rebalanced. <br>
            - A few buggy commander powers have been sorted out. Hopefully they stay that way. <p></p>
            
            
            Holy hell, we got a lot done didn’t we! It’s been a hell of a ride! <br>
            
            Thank you once again to everyone who has supported us on this journey. You have made it all worth it! 

              <p></p>
                        
            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="Nov23Blog">Attack Glitch & Data Corrections Hotfix v.0.5.004</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">13th November 2023</h6> <br>
            <b>Fixes:</b> <br> 
            - There was a specific situation that would cause the melee attacks in battles to break. Sorry about that. It’s fixed now. <br>
            - There was a discrepancy in some of the traditions being shown in the army management screen. We’ve crosschecked and updated all the data files. <br>
            - An issue showing Alexander and Ptolemy as weaker than they were supposed to, was also fixed. <p></p>
            
            Happy conquests to you, good traveller. 
            

              <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="">Achievements Hotfix v.0.5.003</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">12th November 2023</h6> <br>

            <b>Fixes:</b> <br> 
            - We had a couple of buggy achievements. Sorry 'bout that, folks. Should be working now. <br>

              <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="">Settings Hotfix & Difficulty Overhaul v.0.5.002</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">8th November 2023</h6> <br>
            <b>Fixes:</b> <br>
 
            - Settings Panel was the devil. We’ve exorcised this devil. In more serious terms, we’ve had to make a bunch of changes to the Settings Panel and as a result, we’ve had to get rid of the ‘Windowed Mode’ option because it was causing the crashes. We apologize for having to temporarily get rid of this Settings option, but stability comes before quality-of-life.<br>
            There was an issue with Satibarzanes and his animations. Those have been fixed too. <p></p>
            
            <b>Improvements:</b> <br>
             
            - We’ve quietly been planning a difficulty curve overhaul. Since we wanted to put our best foot forward before the next big marketing push before full release, we’ve adopted a more ‘traditional’ difficulty curve where battles becomes progressively harder instead of the battle reflecting the historical difficulty faced by Alexander. <br>
            - A couple more UIs have been polished up. A few resizings and repositionings.

              <p></p>
            
            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="Oct23Blog">Dev Blog 12: New Melee Attack and Attrition!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">29th October 2023</h6> <br>

            Folks… It’s good to be back! Red Thorn Interactive have finally, after many trials and tribulations, released a massive update for AlexanderBall: A Countryball Tale! There’s a lot to go over, so strap in! <p></p>

            <b>Improvements:</b><br>
            - Brand new UI and attacking system that does away with precisely positioning your mouse in the right place to pull off an attack. Now, after selecting the unit you wish to attack with, right click on an enemy in range and new buttons will pop up to help you to pick the direction of your attack!<br>
            - Attrition! You can’t just park your unit between 6 other enemy units and expect them to be all fine and dandy as the turns change. Now, whenever there is a turn change, any unit with adjacent enemy units will have 10 units killed for each adjacent enemy. This should speed up battles and add another layer of strategic depth to battles.<br>
            - The enemy previewer is here! Before a battle, you can check the enemy units that will line up against you… for a small fee.<br>
            - New under-tile indicator UIs when you’re about to do a ranged attack or a volley attack.<br>
            - Two new enemy commanders have been added to local exhibition and 2-player local multiplayer mode.<br>
            - We got brand new UI for the skill trees! We had a few placeholder assets in there that have finally been replaced.<br>
            - Some of the UI have been prettied up - like the settings menu!<br>
            - New prompt before entering a siege battle in the campaigns! No more getting caught out without siege engineers.<br>
            - We’ve added more detail to the Experience Panel that shows up after the battle. Now see how many kills each of your units achieved and how many losses they took as well.<br>
            - An indicator has been added to the Commanders Tab in Army Management if more commanders are capable of being deployed in your formation.<br>
            - We’ve put in a brand new settings/ legacy point/ hall of fame data structure. You guys may have to redo your settings and Legacy Points may have been wiped. We apologize sincerely. (If you want, you can contact us and we can figure out a way for you to get back your meta-game unlocks). <p></p>

            <b>Fixes:</b> <br>
            - A problem with the estimated kills from ranged attacks have been fixed.<br>
            - Sound settings wouldn’t kick-in until you reopen the audio settings panel. This has been fixed.<br>
            - Fixed some visual issues with Satibarzanes. <p></p>

            If you guys have any questions, comments or feedback, please please let us know. We’ll be up and about and ready to fix anything that our QA lads failed to find. Godspeed!
              <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="June23Blog">Dev Blog 11: Exhibition mode and local 2P is live!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">6th June 2023</h6> <br>
              Dear friends, AlexanderBall has put on a new pair of pants and has pockets big enough for an exhibition mode now! Have a particular battle you want to re-fight without getting all the way to Persia to fight it? Now you can in Exhibition mode and tackle challenging battles with whole new combinations of units! There’s a bunch of other little improvements here and there!
              <p></p>

                <b>Improvements:</b> <br>
                - Exhibition single-player and local multiplayer is here! You and your friends can now create your own army and face each other to try out all sorts of funky tactics! <br>
                - 3 New Achievements are in!<br>
                - Tooltips have been added over the level badge in the unit viewer of the battle scene. Hover over it to see each opponent’s skills.<br>
                - A slow-mo cam has been added on the last kill of each battle just to add a bit more umph to your victories.<br>
                - Brand new highlights when you tee up a ranged attack.<br>
                - Gandharan Footmen Tradition has been nerfed, though most of y’all probably haven’t gotten to play with them.<br>
                - Gandharan War Elephants have gained an action point giving them a grand total of 3 to play with on any given turn.<br>
                - Scythian Nomad Horse Archers have lost an action point and some ranged strength.<br>
                - Bactrian Camel Archers have also lost some ranged strength.<br>
                - Fortify and Charge have been nerfed.<br>
                - Hypaspists have had their melee strength and defense nerfed.<br>
                - New graphical improvements to ranged attacks!<br>
                - Gandharans are more expensive now! <p></p>

                <b>Fixes:</b> <br>
                - The Skill-tree UI has been cleaned up a bit.<br>
                - A few missing cutscenes have been added!<br>
                - A few grammatical errors have been fixed!<br>
                - Bugs and missing highlights in the army management screen have been fixed.<br>
                - A couple of skills on some of the commanders were a bit broken. They’ve been patched up. <p></p>

                And that's a wrap for now. Let us know if we've missed any minor bugs.
              <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="Apr23Blog">Bad Random Event and Misc Hotfix v.0.3.004</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">19th April 2023</h6> <br>

              <b>Fixes:</b><p></p>
              - Problem with a faulty random has been fixed. <br>
              - A few regions have been dressed up a little bit nicer. <p></p>
              
              There may or may not have been a couple of other small problems that was patched up really quick.
              <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle">Save and Load Issue Hotfix v.0.3.003</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">16th April 2023</h6> <br>

              <b>Fixes:</b><p></p>
              - Issue with the saves not working have been patched up. We apologize for the inconvenience. <br>
              <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle">Big Update Misc. Hotfixes v.0.3.002</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">15th April 2023</h6> <br>

              <b>Fixes:</b><p></p>

              - When Assyrian Siege Masters in Siege Tower form attacked walls, no damage indicators were visible. That has been fixed. <br>
              - AI Persian Immortals and AI Agrianian Skirmishers will now have limited ranged attacks like their player-controlled counterparts. <br>
              - Some minor highlighting has been fixed in the army management screen. <br>
              <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle">Dev Blog 10: Version 0.3 is ready to go!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">12th April 2023</h6> <br>
            To all our awesome players and supporters, we are back! We apologize for the long wait between the last update and this one, but here it is, in its entire glory - Version 0.3 is ready to play! It was a ton of work, so we took our sweet time with it. Hopefully the delay will be worthwhile! So, without further ado, let’s get into it! </p>

              <p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> As with the last update, old saved games will not work in 0.3.</p>
              
              <p><b>Improvements:</b> <br>
              - You are now entering Persia proper. Beyond Babylon, and through the Persian Gates, Persia lies in wait, with many cities and armies ready to stand in your way!<br>
              - Special Unique Units! Macedonians, Thebans, Cretans, Persians, Agrianians, Gandharans, Bactrians, Assyrians, and Scythians all get unique units in this update.<br>
              - The Macedonian Hypaspists are Light Infantry units capable of using Fortify with only 1 action point.<br>
              - The Theban Band units fight as if their unit size is 100 greater than in actuality.<br>
              - The Cretan Short Bows are more mobile Archers without the ability to unleash volley attacks (this is actually a glorified nerfing).<br>
              - The Agrianian Skirmishers are Light Infantry units capable of unleashing 3 ranged attacks in a single battle.<br>
              - The Persian Immortals are very cool-looking Heavy Infantry units capable of unleashing 2 ranged attacks in a battle.<br>
              - The Gandharan War Elephants are a special Heavy Cavalry unit that can reduce the discipline of adjacent enemy units.<br>
              - The Bactrians Camel Archers are tanky, mobile Archer units!<br>
              - The Scythian Horse Archers are very mobile Archer units!<br>
              - The Assyrian Siege Masters are Engineer units that can create a special siege tower capable of melee attacking walls!<br>
              - Skill trees for every unit have been added! Based on their role. For example, all Light Infantry units have access to the same Infantry Skill tree!<br>
              - Brand new UI for Secret Dialogues.<br>
              - A bunch of new achievements have been coded into the game. Enjoy being rewarded for making it deep into Persia and for winning specific battles with specific units in your army.<br>
              - Battles across the classic campaign have been altered to include special units. Some of these battles, I expect are going to significantly harder.<br>
              - As with every big update, AI has gotten better. And they know how to use special units. Be careful.
            </p>
              
              
              <p><b>Fixes:</b><br>
              - A couple of fixes with respect to objectives have been made.<br>
              - The badges/shields indicating the level of a unit were not updating correctly in the case of enemy units during a battle.<br>
              - Ariarathes looked way too big in the unit viewer in the battle scene.<br>
              - A Lydian Light Infantry in the Battle of Granicus had too much discipline for some reason.
            </p>

              <p>So, that was a whole bunch of information. I hope it was digestible. Let us know if you come across any errors or bugs and we will do our best to squash them with haste.</p>
              Happy Conquering!
              </p> <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle">Dev Blog 9: Version 0.2 is here!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">26th February 2023</h6> <br>
            It is a glorious day here at Red Thorn Interactive! We have put together our much anticipated 0.2 version of AlexanderBall and it is now available to all. There a bunch of new features that have been added this time around and I can’t wait to see what you guys think. We’ve had a ton of good feedback and the support we have seen has truly warmed our hearts. So without further ado, let us get into the new additions and bug fixes!</p>

              <p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> Old saved games will not work in 0.2</p>
              
              <p><b>Improvements:</b><br>
              - Conquer the regions of Assyria & Mesopotamia and take your first steps into the heart of Persia with the newest additions to the story!<br>
              - The brand new garrison system is available. You can’t just be conquering one city after another without leaving behind some loyal troops. Now each conquered Point of Interest requires you leave behind a number of Macedonian soldiers to make sure the city keeps its loyalty.<br>
              - A number of garrison system related random events have been added to the game.<br>
              - Brand new roads between Points of Interests.<br>
              - ENGINEERS! No more catapults. But, you can recruit engineer units and they can transform themselves into siege towers, catapults, and ballistas!<br>
              - A brand new Point of Interest UI has been added that is more readable, more in-line with our theme and includes the garrisoning UI.<br>
              - Cleaned up the mess of buttons on the battle scene. You no longer need to look at a greyed-out charge button while you have an archer selected.<br>
              - Randomized battle generation has been fixed.<br>
              - You can nickname your units!<br>
              - Units in siege don’t eerily stand in place and give back their turn.
              </p>
              
              <p><b>Fixes:</b><br>
              - Even more random events have been patched up.<br>
              - Fixed the bug where the buildings did not build unless you babysit in the region.<br>
              - Fixed animation and state change bugs with a number of units.<br>
              - Fixed animation issues with a couple of the commanders.<br>
              - Cheating should have gone down. There’s a real finicky bug in the underbelly of the game that makes the AI sometimes use a couple more action points than they are supposed to. We’re working on it!!
             </p>
              
              Can’t wait to find out all the new bugs. We’ve done our due diligence but we’ve learned that no amount of bug testing will prepare the product for the hands of the players. Also, should we make a video that explains the new siege units? Let us know what you guys think. <br>

            <h2 class="blogTitle">Dev Blog 8: AI & Legacy Point Shop Fixes v0.1.015!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">15th February 2023</h6> <br>
            And Red Thorn Interactive are back with a brand new update right after Valentine’s Day! And let me tell you, it is, by no means, a themed update.
              So what did we fix this time around? </p>
              
              <p><b>Improvements:</b><br>
              - AI is much much better now. Like, they may actually be hard to beat if you’re not being careful. So, watch out! <br>
              - Siege battle AI has been improved to ensure that players can’t defeat all enemies without breaking the wall.<br>
              - Tooltips have been added to the Legacy Point Shop.<br>
              - A button linking to the subreddit has been added to the main menu.
            </p>
              
              
            <p><b>Fixes:</b><br>
              - A ton of buggy random events have been fixed up!<br>
              - The bug that happens when players go from region-to-region with the army management open, has been fixed.<br>
              - The bug where a selected enemy unit on a small hill did not have the ‘On Hill’ icon, has been fixed.<br>
              - Weird emblem placement on the Gandharan Archer units have been fixed.<br>
              - Finicky resolution issues have been fixed!
            </p>

              <p>Hope you guys have fun. And just to clarify, this isn't the big big update that we've been talking about in our discord channel. That's still coming up and will be called v.0.2.001. So stay tuned!
              </p>
              </p> <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="Jan23Blog">Autosave & Misc. Hotfix v.0.1.012</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">29th January 2023</h6> <br>
            <p><b>Fixes:</b> <br>

              - The notorious bug where the story is broken after burning down Thebes is now fixed! <br>
              - Tooltips weren’t showing up in battle. That has been patched up. <br>
              - More tweaks to the autosave.
              </p> <p></p>


            <h2 class="blogTitle">Autosave & Misc. Hotfix v.0.1.012</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">26th January 2023</h6> <br>
            <p><b>Fixes:</b><br>

              - Fixed issue with objectives not showing up sometimes. <br>
              - Fixed issue with supersized Bactrian units.<br>
              - Polished the autosave mechanic.<br>
              - Fixed-up a few of the random events.
              
              
              Thank you guys again for letting us know about these niggling issues. Turns out they were far too buggy to ship out so early.
              </p> <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle">Dev Blog 6: Major Fixes and Quality of Life Changes v0.1.011!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">24th January 2023</h6> <br>
            <p>Hello folks! It’s been a wild week at Red Thorn Interactive, let me tell you.
              There has been a number of major, and minor fixes throughout the game over the past 48 hours. We’ve heard everything you guys have said. Not everything could be implemented at the moment, but a lot has been. </p>
              
              <p>We think you guys will like it.</p>
              
              <p>So let’s get into what all is new.</p>
              
              <p><b>Improvements:</b><br>
              - Tooltips have been dramatically improved in the battles! They now convey information in a much more readable way. We’ve also converted all the tooltips in that screen to our internal tooltip system (the same one used in the army management screen). <br>
              - Big balance changes! Archers have less ranged strength. Heavy infantry and heavy cavalry have less defense. 1,2, and 3-star units have been strengthened and 5-star units have been weakened.<br>
              - There’s a big change to the saving system. Here we have to apologize. We had taken out our autosave system but never remembered to take the autosave button off the settings menu. Now we have fixed the autosave system and new games will begin with autosave ‘On’ by default.<br>
              - Save files now have a relevant version number. Older saves may cause issues in-game so we decided that saved files will only work with the correct versions of the game.<br>
              - The AI in siege battles is smarter now. No more can the player just kill all the enemies by shooting over the wall with no retaliation.<br>
              - Bows have been added to the archer units when they do their attack animations.
            </p>
              
              
              <p><b>Bug Fixes:</b><br>
              - The effects of leveling up is now clearer with tooltips in both army management and battle screens.<br>
              - The player did not get Athenian catapults in between the two Thebes battles even though the dialogue mentioned such. That has been fixed.<br>
              - When the player burned a city down, the incomes associated with that city remained. This has been fixed.<br>
              - Bug when transitioning from Act 1 to Act 2 has been fixed.<br>
              - Issue with the battle at Issus has been fixed because of changes to the save system mentioned above.<br>
              - Issue where the enemy archers would fire enemies within 4 tiles instead of within 5 tiles, has been fixed.
              </p>
              <p>And that is all for now folks. I’m sure there will be stuff to fix about these fixes that are going out. So, if anything catches your eye, let us know, for the sake of AlexanderBall.</p>
              
              <p>Thank you again to everyone who has gone out and bought the game thus far. Your support means a tonne to us, and we will do our best to make sure AlexanderBall is the best 10 dollars you ever spend.</p>
              </p> <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle">Dev Blog 5: Our First Regular Update v0.1.010!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">22nd January 2023</h6> <br>
            <p>Ignore the weird version number. Once you’ve done that, you can notice a number of gameplay changes, aesthetic improvements, story improvements, AI improvements and more. <p></p>

            <p>The full list of changes in this update is down below!</p>
              
              <p></p><b>Improvements:</b><br>
              - New visual indicator for showing damage to walls. <br>
              - New asset for the arrow that is used to go from one region to another.<br>
              - AI uses more ranged attacks now.<br>
              - Macedonian manpower has been nerfed.<br>
              - Warning that all unsaved data will be lost has been added to the battle screen after pressing the ‘Exit to Main Menu’ button from there.<br>
              - Replaced the placeholder ‘Confirm building’ Icon with a much better icon.<br>
              - Tutorial clips have been updated. They were ancient. </p>
              
              <p><b>Bug Fixes:</b><br>
              - Bug that lets the player sometimes use the enemy units to attack other enemy units has been fixed. Phew…<br>
              - Bug when selecting ‘No’ on the retire option has been fixed.<br>
              - Random events with battles were not starting the battles correctly. This has been fixed.<br>
              - Icon for Alexandria was getting cut around the edges. That’s been fixed.<br>
              - Fixed a bug where the birds on the regional maps froze. </p>
              
              Hopefully these changes don’t impact anyone’s saved games. If they do, please let us know. (Yes, you can keep the Macedonian manpower you accumulated - they just won’t be going up at such a high speed anymore).
              </p> <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="Dec22Blog">Dev Blog 4: Update, Roadmap, and Early Access Release Date!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">14th December 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>Hello one and all! Today’s Dev Blog is a special one. <p></p>

              You guys may have noticed that the playtest is no longer available. That’s cause we are in the final phase of testing and bug-fixing before Early Access release! It is in this time that we have decided to announce the release date for AlexanderBall: A Countryball Tale! <p></p>
              
              So, without further ado, we at Red Thorn Interactive are proud to announce that AlexanderBall: A Countryball Tale will enter Early Access on the 15th of January, 2023! <p></p>
              
              So what can you guys expect? A host of new additions are coming into the game during early access. <br>
              The most important of these are the addition of the diplomacy and building systems. At long last, AlexanderBall can build a bunch of cities named after himself throughout the ancient world. At long last, AlexanderBall can threaten the myriad peoples of his vast empire, demand tributes, send gifts, and take hostages! <p></p>
              
              The diplomacy tab will allow AlexanderBall to see what his subjects think of him and the exact reasons why they may not want to send their young men to die in his conquests. <p></p>
              
              We’re adding in 4 new resources - Wine, Salt, Food, and Iron! <br>
              You can use Iron for hiring new units, Wine for holding festivals in your different cities, Food to keep your populations fed, and Salt to pay your soldiers in wages (this bit may not be historically accurate… welp). <p></p>
              
              Siege battles!! (Need we say more for this one?) <p></p>
              
              The random events system is ready to go! <br>
              Over 120 random events have been added to the game. Taking a leaf from many other historical strategy games before us, we believe these random events can add a lot of replayability to our game and make the whole experience more immersive. <p></p>
              
              We’re implementing a Legacy Point system! <br>
              Now players can lose campaigns, secure in the knowledge that they have earned some Legacy Points and can go into the next run with some permanent upgrades. <p></p>
              
              At early access, the classic campaign will extend up to the Battle of Guagamela! <br>
              Players will be able to romp their way through Greece, Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, and reach the gates of Persia in the upcoming Early Access release. <p></p>
              
              After the early access release, there will be monthly updates until we reach the summer of 2023 (we hope to enter full release around then). So, after early access release, be sure to drop-by. In the months following January 15th, players can expect more random events, a building system that lets the player customize individual cities, multiplayer battles, unique units, and whatever else fun mechanics we can come up with! <p></p>

              <h6 class="blogDate">12th November 2022</h6> <br>
              <p>Hey guys. Sorry for the late update about the update. Nonetheless, we’ve managed to add a few things and patch a couple of holes over the past week. <p></p>

            <h6 class="blogDate">2nd November 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>Hello again! This is a tiny update for some tiny updates. Here they are: <br>
              - Fixed music not playing in the 2nd Regional Map <br>
              - Fixed an error in the dialogue where apostrophes were messed up <br>
              - The bottom-left UI element has been polished up. <p></p>

              </p> <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle">Dev Blog 3: Reviewing the October Next Fest & New Open Beta!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">1st November 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>So, October Next Fest happened and we just about managed to get a demo out there. It was not good. Buggy UI, slow battles, and limited content were the consistent takeaways from our demo release and we have to admit that there is a long way to go. Nonetheless, we appreciate all the feedback and couldn’t be more pumped to make the game even better for everyone involved. We had initially planned to release the Early Access game at the end of October, but it is safe to say that would mean an unfinished, rushed and buggy game would be getting released. 
              <p></p>
              We have decided that the best thing we could do for the game would be to push back our Early Access release to a latter date - most likely something like 2 months later than planned. 
              <p></p>
              In exchange, we will be adding a couple more features and giving you this - a brand new open beta that you guys can enjoy! It has the same content as the last version with the following changes and additions. Let us know what you guys think. We will be sure to take into account all your feedback and critiques! 
              <p></p>
              You can expect the following changes and bug fixes in the new version of the playtest.
              <p></p>
              Additions and Changes:<br>
              - Reduced the number of tiles on the battlefield so it takes less time to reach enemies.<br>
              - Introductory cutscenes have been added to better prime the player before tossing them into the game. <br>
              - Improved tutorials.<br>
              - Battles have been made more responsive and faster.<br>
              - Buttons that can be pressed multiple times but were not intended to be used as such have been fixed.<br>
              - Much better AI.<br>
              - Symbols to indicate a city is under Macedonian rule has been added.<br>
              - Commanders now regenerate Unit Size by 5 per month until they reach the maximum of 300.<br>
              - Regular units now regenerate Unit Morale by 5 per month until they reach the maximum of 100.<br>
              - Improved hotkeys.<br>
              - A UI has been added to the battle screen that tells the player how much damage will be inflicted by an attack and why.<br>
              - Added screens to tell the player which part of the story they are in.<br>
              - Added auto pausing and unpausing based on events and story dialogue.<br>
              <br>
              Bugs Fixes:<br>
              - Fixed the issue of the army formation mat messing up when a general is added and then removed from the mat.<br>
              - Tutorials now show up at the right times and right places.<br>
              - AI units no longer spend more action points than they are supposed to.<br>
              - Fixed issue of Thessalian manpower reserves not increasing according to conquered cities.<br>
              - Small data and data-display related issues have been fixed.<br>
              
              SO, with that out of the way, we proudly present, our brand new Open Beta/Playtest!! Please, please, please, let us know what you guys think. We need good feedback so we can make the most possible game and story for everyone.<br>
              </p> <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="July22Blog">Dev Blog 2: Demo Details!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">21st July 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>Hello guys! We’re back with more details of your favorite spherical conqueror! <p></p>

              The demo is incoming. The team has been putting in hard shifts to bring you our first title. As said before, the game takes the player through the various regions of the known world. Alexander and his army will conquer and live through iconic moments that have travelled down to us even in this day and age. <p></p>
              
              All this said, the demo will let the player play through the initial stages of Alexander’s conquest (there will be an accompanying post on #history-time in our Discord channel to elaborate on the time period). The opening part of the story start’s with the death of Philip the 2nd and Alexander's troubled accession to the throne. The player will explore the first 2 regions of the 17 in the Eastern/Classic campaign. This will entail beating down the tribes in the northern frontiers - PaeoniaBall, IllyriaBall and ThraceBall! After that, the player will turn south to tackle the various Greek cities. <p></p>
              
              There will be cutscenes of some of the moments that made Alexander such an enigma (one famous incident involving a certain ancient Greek philosopher will be amongst these early cutscenes). The player will be introduced to the intricacies of our battle system, the story, the objectives system, the army building and army management system and will have a couple dozen random events to experience as well. 2 of the 8 commanders under Alexander will also be deployable, alongside Alexander himself! We are hoping to include a siege battle in the demo, but I’m not sure we can promise that so early. Most likely, there will be a second version of the demo that includes a siege battle! <p></p>
              
              Thanks again for your patience. Also if anyone is interested in take part in QA testing, message us on <span class="blog3steam"><a href="https://twitter.com/RedThornInterac">Twitter</a></span>  (@RedThornInterac) or <span class="blog3steam"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RedThornInteractive/">Reddit</a></span>  (u/redthorninteractive)! <p></p>
              
              Thanks again for your patience. Your support means a lot to us and we can’t wait to get out a great game for you guys!

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="June22Blog">Dev Blog 1.0: Tentative Roadmap</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">5th June 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>Hello wonderful reader! <p></p>
              Welcome to our first big developer’s blog. There’s a number of things to go over. We want to let you guys know how much has been done and what is currently in the works. Once again, a quick reminder that Early Access includes a single campaign, the one that recounts the historic adventures and conquests of Alexander the Great as he conquered the Achaemenid Empire. This first campaign, and many of its underlying systems and required art and animations have kept the team busy over the last 6 months of development. Building a good turn-based combat system is quite a task and the team has done fantastically-well in this department. The design team has been slogging away at crafting the story, the 100+ random events, and the many, many tooltips that make a strategy game easily-digestible. And of course, bugs are being squashed. <p></p>
              As the title implies, we will set out a bit of a roadmap for the future of this game and its development. A beta version for testing will be our first big and holistic milestone. Then we will hope to release a demo which will allow those interested to download a concatenated version of the game and see if they like what we offer. Finally, the game will then enter early access where folks can pledge their support, play through the first campaign and enjoy multiplayer battles. Purchasers can expect further updates and free additions through the Early Access period and then expect a full version of the game with all 2 additional campaigns that explore alternative historical outcomes had Alexander chosen a different direction to undertake his conquests. <p></p>
              Our followers, well-wishers and wishlisters can expect improvements being made in every aspect of the game at all times. We do not intend to stop until the product we have on our hands gives our audience their money’s worth and also provides dozens of hours of entertainment. <br>         
              Wish us luck and please wishlist on <span class="blog3steam"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1944660/AlexanderBall_A_Countryball_Tale/">Steam!</a></span></p> <br>

            <h6 class="blogDate">11th May 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>It’s time! We’re officially up on <span class="blog3steam"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1944660/AlexanderBall_A_Countryball_Tale/">Steam!</a></span>
              Take a look around the store page, SMASH THAT WISHLIST BUTTON, and tell a friend as always! <p></p>
              The screenshots will give a great idea of how the regional maps will look. The army management tool is a big task that we’re working on but the UI design for this is ready to show. The regional map screenshots are based in the Western Asia Minor region, the third region of 17 in the first campaign. Each region is being made with as much respect for the local geography and climate as we can figure out. The regions are populated by ancient cities, temples, ruins, and villages with each having its own composition of Balls inhabiting them. Each of these ‘points of interest’ also provide the player and Alexander with Gold and Glory per month as the game progresses as well as a steady supply of troops based on the local Balls! <p></p>
              And yes, when not in a battle, the game will use a ‘real-time with pause’ feature. Much like in other grand strategy games that utilize this ‘real-time with pause’ system, Alexander and the player will face hundreds of random events throughout the game that include things like battles with bandits, dealing with scuffles within the player’s armies, random drunks, superstitious natives and much, much more! <p></p>
              The team is hard at work piecing together the first campaign’s regions, implementing UI systems, crafting amazing cutscenes, writing the story and picking out music for the game. Let us know what you guys think so far.<p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="April22Blog">Dev Blog 0.2: Getting on Steam</h2> 
            <h6 class="blogDate">4th April 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>Hello folks! It’s been a while since our last Developer’s Blog so I figured it’s time for another update. The last blog went through some of the motivations for our game, how the units work, and also briefly mentioned some of the other features we plan on implementing. Today maybe a good time to update you guys on the progress we’ve made on many fronts for the game. Some of you may know that getting a steam store page up requires a atleast 5 screenshots and for these to be effective, all advice seems to suggest developers show as many aspects of their game as possible. For this reason, we have been polishing our battle screen, our regional map screen, and the army management UI. We’ve had a story-based cutscene drawn (which we can’t wait to reveal). We’ve finalized how are random events will look and be displayed. So these aspects of our game have had us busy in recent weeks but I’m glad to report that this period of polishing has paid off. Steam is in the process of verifying our page and we are hoping it’ll be up by the end of the week. <p></p>
            Now, I guess you guys may have noticed we haven’t shown any battles or regional screens yet. That is only because we’ve been saving stuff we can use for marketing for when the steam page is up. That way we could redirect some of the eyeballs to a steam page where hopefully some of them also wishlist our game. We’re very excited to showcase all our hard work as much as some of you guys are excited to see it. The time for that is tantalizingly close. <p></p>
            Stay tuned folks!
            </p> <br>

            
            <h2 class="blogTitle">Dev Blog 0.1: Hello World! </h2> 
            <h6 class="blogDate">17th April 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>
            Today marks the first Dev Blog about Red Thorn Interactive’s first game AlexanderBall: A Countryball Tale. <br><br>
            This game is inspired by a love of history and the way the Countryball/Polandball community represents complex topics through light, digestible aesthetics. In keeping with this spirit, our game hopes to tell the story of Alexander the Great and his conquests over diverse lands. <p></p>
            We are designing this game to take the player through a variety of regions populated by various ‘Balls’. We are going with turn-based combat inspired by the likes of Heroes of Might and Magic for our combat system. Overarching that and the aforementioned regional map is an army management system, a diplomacy system and some empire-management features. We are also preparing a host of random events that can occur as the player traverses the regional maps and will be linking these events to every aspect of gameplay. <p></p>
            Now we will draw attention to the features of our game that are relatively original. We are hoping, at early access, to release most of the first campaign minus the end credits, and a surprise feature (one designed to properly cap off the first campaign). We have created a over 100 units from 21 ‘Balls' and a set of 5/6 roles. This would be something like a unit of Macedonian Light Infantry or Athenian Heavy Cavalry. This design choice lets us create an army management system that will allow the player to pick, for each battle, 8 units for their army out of a total of 110 unique units in our game (excluding commander units who have special area of effect buffs and debuffs). Now doing a little bit of math tells us that the player will theoretically have access to billions if not trillions of unique army combinations. That’s a lot to play around with, we hope. We think this would not only make for a highly replayable and somewhat historically-accurate campaign but also allow for a pretty wild multiplayer scene. <p></p>
            That's all for this dev blog!
