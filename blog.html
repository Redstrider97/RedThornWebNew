            <p>Hello folks! It’s been a while since our last Developer’s Blog so I figured it’s time for another update. The last blog went through some of the motivations for our game, how the units work, and also briefly mentioned some of the other features we plan on implementing. Today maybe a good time to update you guys on the progress we’ve made on many fronts for the game. Some of you may know that getting a steam store page up requires a atleast 5 screenshots and for these to be effective, all advice seems to suggest developers show as many aspects of their game as possible. For this reason, we have been polishing our battle screen, our regional map screen, and the army management UI. We’ve had a story-based cutscene drawn (which we can’t wait to reveal). We’ve finalized how are random events will look and be displayed. So these aspects of our game have had us busy in recent weeks but I’m glad to report that this period of polishing has paid off. Steam is in the process of verifying our page and we are hoping it’ll be up by the end of the week. <br> <br>
            Now, I guess you guys may have noticed we haven’t shown any battles or regional screens yet. That is only because we’ve been saving stuff we can use for marketing for when the steam page is up. That way we could redirect some of the eyeballs to a steam page where hopefully some of them also wishlist our game. We’re very excited to showcase all our hard work as much as some of you guys are excited to see it. The time for that is tantalizingly close. <br> <br> 
            Stay tuned folks!
            </p> <br>

            <p>
            Today marks the first Dev Blog about Red Thorn Interactive’s first game AlexanderBall: A Countryball Tale. <br><br>
            This game is inspired by a love of history and the way the Countryball/Polandball community represents complex topics through light, digestible aesthetics. In keeping with this spirit, our game hopes to tell the story of Alexander the Great and his conquests over diverse lands. <br><br>
            We are designing this game to take the player through a variety of regions populated by various ‘Balls’. We are going with turn-based combat inspired by the likes of Heroes of Might and Magic for our combat system. Overarching that and the aforementioned regional map is an army management system, a diplomacy system and some empire-management features. We are also preparing a host of random events that can occur as the player traverses the regional maps and will be linking these events to every aspect of gameplay. <br><br>
            Now we will draw attention to the features of our game that are relatively original. We are hoping, at early access, to release most of the first campaign minus the end credits, and a surprise feature (one designed to properly cap off the first campaign). We have created a over 100 units from 21 ‘Balls' and a set of 5/6 roles. This would be something like a unit of Macedonian Light Infantry or Athenian Heavy Cavalry. This design choice lets us create an army management system that will allow the player to pick, for each battle, 8 units for their army out of a total of 110 unique units in our game (excluding commander units who have special area of effect buffs and debuffs). Now doing a little bit of math tells us that the player will theoretically have access to billions if not trillions of unique army combinations. That’s a lot to play around with, we hope. We think this would not only make for a highly replayable and somewhat historically-accurate campaign but also allow for a pretty wild multiplayer scene. <br><br>
            That's all for this dev blog!
