            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="Jan23Blog">Dev Blog 5: Our First Regular Update v0.1.010!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">22nd January 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>Ignore the weird version number. Once you‚Äôve done that, you can notice a number of gameplay changes, aesthetic improvements, story improvements, AI improvements and more. <p></p>

              The full list of changes in this update is down below! <p></p>
              
              Improvements: <br>
              - New visual indicator for showing damage to walls. <br>
              - New asset for the arrow that is used to go from one region to another.<br>
              - AI uses more ranged attacks now.<br>
              - Macedonian manpower has been nerfed.<br>
              - Warning that all unsaved data will be lost has been added to the battle screen after pressing the ‚ÄòExit to Main Menu‚Äô button from there.<br>
              - Replaced the placeholder ‚ÄòConfirm building‚Äô Icon with a much better icon.<br>
              - Tutorial clips have been updated. They were ancient. <p></p>
              
              Bug Fixes:<br>
              - Bug that lets the player sometimes use the enemy units to attack other enemy units has been fixed. Phew‚Ä¶<br>
              - Bug when selecting ‚ÄòNo‚Äô on the retire option has been fixed.<br>
              - Random events with battles were not starting the battles correctly. This has been fixed.<br>
              - Icon for Alexandria was getting cut around the edges. That‚Äôs been fixed.<br>
              - Fixed a bug where the birds on the regional maps froze. <p></p>
              
              Hopefully these changes don‚Äôt impact anyone‚Äôs saved games. If they do, please let us know. (Yes, you can keep the Macedonian manpower you accumulated - they just won‚Äôt be going up at such a high speed anymore).

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="Dec22Blog">Dev Blog 4: Update, Roadmap, and Early Access Release Date!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">14th December 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>Hello one and all! Today‚Äôs Dev Blog is a special one. <p></p>

              You guys may have noticed that the playtest is no longer available. That‚Äôs cause we are in the final phase of testing and bug-fixing before Early Access release! It is in this time that we have decided to announce the release date for AlexanderBall: A Countryball Tale! <p></p>
              
              So, without further ado, we at Red Thorn Interactive are proud to announce that AlexanderBall: A Countryball Tale will enter Early Access on the 15th of January, 2023! <p></p>
              
              So what can you guys expect? A host of new additions are coming into the game during early access. <br>
              The most important of these are the addition of the diplomacy and building systems. At long last, AlexanderBall can build a bunch of cities named after himself throughout the ancient world. At long last, AlexanderBall can threaten the myriad peoples of his vast empire, demand tributes, send gifts, and take hostages! <p></p>
              
              The diplomacy tab will allow AlexanderBall to see what his subjects think of him and the exact reasons why they may not want to send their young men to die in his conquests. <p></p>
              
              We‚Äôre adding in 4 new resources - Wine, Salt, Food, and Iron! <br>
              You can use Iron for hiring new units, Wine for holding festivals in your different cities, Food to keep your populations fed, and Salt to pay your soldiers in wages (this bit may not be historically accurate‚Ä¶ welp). <p></p>
              
              Siege battles!! (Need we say more for this one?) <p></p>
              
              The random events system is ready to go! <br>
              Over 120 random events have been added to the game. Taking a leaf from many other historical strategy games before us, we believe these random events can add a lot of replayability to our game and make the whole experience more immersive. <p></p>
              
              We‚Äôre implementing a Legacy Point system! <br>
              Now players can lose campaigns, secure in the knowledge that they have earned some Legacy Points and can go into the next run with some permanent upgrades. <p></p>
              
              At early access, the classic campaign will extend up to the Battle of Guagamela! <br>
              Players will be able to romp their way through Greece, Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, and reach the gates of Persia in the upcoming Early Access release. <p></p>
              
              After the early access release, there will be monthly updates until we reach the summer of 2023 (we hope to enter full release around then). So, after early access release, be sure to drop-by. In the months following January 15th, players can expect more random events, a building system that lets the player customize individual cities, multiplayer battles, unique units, and whatever else fun mechanics we can come up with! <p></p>

              <p>Hey guys. Sorry for the late update about the update. Nonetheless, we‚Äôve managed to add a few things and patch a couple of holes over the past week. <p></p>

            <h6 class="blogDate">2nd November 2022</h6> <br>

              </p> <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle">Dev Blog 3: Reviewing the October Next Fest & New Open Beta!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">1st November 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>So, October Next Fest happened and we just about managed to get a demo out there. It was not good. Buggy UI, slow battles, and limited content were the consistent takeaways from our demo release and we have to admit that there is a long way to go. Nonetheless, we appreciate all the feedback and couldn‚Äôt be more pumped to make the game even better for everyone involved. We had initially planned to release the Early Access game at the end of October, but it is safe to say that would mean an unfinished, rushed and buggy game would be getting released. 
              <p></p>
              We have decided that the best thing we could do for the game would be to push back our Early Access release to a latter date - most likely something like 2 months later than planned. 
              <p></p>
              In exchange, we will be adding a couple more features and giving you this - a brand new open beta that you guys can enjoy! It has the same content as the last version with the following changes and additions. Let us know what you guys think. We will be sure to take into account all your feedback and critiques! 
              <p></p>
              You can expect the following changes and bug fixes in the new version of the playtest.
              <p></p>
              Additions and Changes:<br>
              - Reduced the number of tiles on the battlefield so it takes less time to reach enemies.<br>
              - Introductory cutscenes have been added to better prime the player before tossing them into the game. <br>
              - Improved tutorials.<br>
              - Battles have been made more responsive and faster.<br>
              - Buttons that can be pressed multiple times but were not intended to be used as such have been fixed.<br>
              - Much better AI.<br>
              - Symbols to indicate a city is under Macedonian rule has been added.<br>
              - Commanders now regenerate Unit Size by 5 per month until they reach the maximum of 300.<br>
              - Regular units now regenerate Unit Morale by 5 per month until they reach the maximum of 100.<br>
              - Improved hotkeys.<br>
              - A UI has been added to the battle screen that tells the player how much damage will be inflicted by an attack and why.<br>
              - Added screens to tell the player which part of the story they are in.<br>
              - Added auto pausing and unpausing based on events and story dialogue.<br>
              <br>
              Bugs Fixes:<br>
              - Fixed the issue of the army formation mat messing up when a general is added and then removed from the mat.<br>
              - Tutorials now show up at the right times and right places.<br>
              - AI units no longer spend more action points than they are supposed to.<br>
              - Fixed issue of Thessalian manpower reserves not increasing according to conquered cities.<br>
              - Small data and data-display related issues have been fixed.<br>
              
              SO, with that out of the way, we proudly present, our brand new Open Beta/Playtest!! Please, please, please, let us know what you guys think. We need good feedback so we can make the most possible game and story for everyone.<br>
              </p> <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="July22Blog">Dev Blog 2: Demo Details!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">21st July 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>Hello guys! We‚Äôre back with more details of your favorite spherical conqueror! <p></p>

              The demo is incoming. The team has been putting in hard shifts to bring you our first title. As said before, the game takes the player through the various regions of the known world. Alexander and his army will conquer and live through iconic moments that have travelled down to us even in this day and age. <p></p>
              
              All this said, the demo will let the player play through the initial stages of Alexander‚Äôs conquest (there will be an accompanying post on #history-time in our Discord channel to elaborate on the time period). The opening part of the story start‚Äôs with the death of Philip the 2nd and Alexander's troubled accession to the throne. The player will explore the first 2 regions of the 17 in the Eastern/Classic campaign. This will entail beating down the tribes in the northern frontiers - PaeoniaBall, IllyriaBall and ThraceBall! After that, the player will turn south to tackle the various Greek cities. <p></p>
              
              There will be cutscenes of some of the moments that made Alexander such an enigma (one famous incident involving a certain ancient Greek philosopher will be amongst these early cutscenes). The player will be introduced to the intricacies of our battle system, the story, the objectives system, the army building and army management system and will have a couple dozen random events to experience as well. 2 of the 8 commanders under Alexander will also be deployable, alongside Alexander himself! We are hoping to include a siege battle in the demo, but I‚Äôm not sure we can promise that so early. Most likely, there will be a second version of the demo that includes a siege battle! <p></p>
              
              Thanks again for your patience. Also if anyone is interested in take part in QA testing, message us on <span class="blog3steam"><a href="https://twitter.com/RedThornInterac">Twitter</a></span>  (@RedThornInterac) or <span class="blog3steam"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RedThornInteractive/">Reddit</a></span>  (u/redthorninteractive)! <p></p>
              
              Thanks again for your patience. Your support means a lot to us and we can‚Äôt wait to get out a great game for you guys!
              </p> <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="June22Blog">Dev Blog 1.0: Tentative Roadmap</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">5th June 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>Hello wonderful reader! <p></p>
              Welcome to our first big developer‚Äôs blog. There‚Äôs a number of things to go over. We want to let you guys know how much has been done and what is currently in the works. Once again, a quick reminder that Early Access includes a single campaign, the one that recounts the historic adventures and conquests of Alexander the Great as he conquered the Achaemenid Empire. This first campaign, and many of its underlying systems and required art and animations have kept the team busy over the last 6 months of development. Building a good turn-based combat system is quite a task and the team has done fantastically-well in this department. The design team has been slogging away at crafting the story, the 100+ random events, and the many, many tooltips that make a strategy game easily-digestible. And of course, bugs are being squashed. <p></p>
              As the title implies, we will set out a bit of a roadmap for the future of this game and its development. A beta version for testing will be our first big and holistic milestone. Then we will hope to release a demo which will allow those interested to download a concatenated version of the game and see if they like what we offer. Finally, the game will then enter early access where folks can pledge their support, play through the first campaign and enjoy multiplayer battles. Purchasers can expect further updates and free additions through the Early Access period and then expect a full version of the game with all 2 additional campaigns that explore alternative historical outcomes had Alexander chosen a different direction to undertake his conquests. <p></p>
              Our followers, well-wishers and wishlisters can expect improvements being made in every aspect of the game at all times. We do not intend to stop until the product we have on our hands gives our audience their money‚Äôs worth and also provides dozens of hours of entertainment. <br>         
              Wish us luck and please wishlist on <span class="blog3steam"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1944660/AlexanderBall_A_Countryball_Tale/">Steam!</a></span></p> <br>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="May22Blog">Dev Blog 0.3: On Steam!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">11th May 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>It‚Äôs time! We‚Äôre officially up on <span class="blog3steam"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1944660/AlexanderBall_A_Countryball_Tale/">Steam!</a></span>
              Take a look around the store page, SMASH THAT WISHLIST BUTTON, and tell a friend as always! <p></p>
              The screenshots will give a great idea of how the regional maps will look. The army management tool is a big task that we‚Äôre working on but the UI design for this is ready to show. The regional map screenshots are based in the Western Asia Minor region, the third region of 17 in the first campaign. Each region is being made with as much respect for the local geography and climate as we can figure out. The regions are populated by ancient cities, temples, ruins, and villages with each having its own composition of Balls inhabiting them. Each of these ‚Äòpoints of interest‚Äô also provide the player and Alexander with Gold and Glory per month as the game progresses as well as a steady supply of troops based on the local Balls! <p></p>
              And yes, when not in a battle, the game will use a ‚Äòreal-time with pause‚Äô feature. Much like in other grand strategy games that utilize this ‚Äòreal-time with pause‚Äô system, Alexander and the player will face hundreds of random events throughout the game that include things like battles with bandits, dealing with scuffles within the player‚Äôs armies, random drunks, superstitious natives and much, much more! <p></p>
              The team is hard at work piecing together the first campaign‚Äôs regions, implementing UI systems, crafting amazing cutscenes, writing the story and picking out music for the game. Let us know what you guys think so far.<p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="April22Blog">Dev Blog 0.2: Getting on Steam</h2> 
            <h6 class="blogDate">4th April 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>Hello folks! It‚Äôs been a while since our last Developer‚Äôs Blog so I figured it‚Äôs time for another update. The last blog went through some of the motivations for our game, how the units work, and also briefly mentioned some of the other features we plan on implementing. Today maybe a good time to update you guys on the progress we‚Äôve made on many fronts for the game. Some of you may know that getting a steam store page up requires a atleast 5 screenshots and for these to be effective, all advice seems to suggest developers show as many aspects of their game as possible. For this reason, we have been polishing our battle screen, our regional map screen, and the army management UI. We‚Äôve had a story-based cutscene drawn (which we can‚Äôt wait to reveal). We‚Äôve finalized how are random events will look and be displayed. So these aspects of our game have had us busy in recent weeks but I‚Äôm glad to report that this period of polishing has paid off. Steam is in the process of verifying our page and we are hoping it‚Äôll be up by the end of the week. <p></p>
            Now, I guess you guys may have noticed we haven‚Äôt shown any battles or regional screens yet. That is only because we‚Äôve been saving stuff we can use for marketing for when the steam page is up. That way we could redirect some of the eyeballs to a steam page where hopefully some of them also wishlist our game. We‚Äôre very excited to showcase all our hard work as much as some of you guys are excited to see it. The time for that is tantalizingly close. <p></p>
            Stay tuned folks!
            </p> <br>

            Today marks the first Dev Blog about Red Thorn Interactive‚Äôs first game AlexanderBall: A Countryball Tale. <br><br>
            This game is inspired by a love of history and the way the Countryball/Polandball community represents complex topics through light, digestible aesthetics. In keeping with this spirit, our game hopes to tell the story of Alexander the Great and his conquests over diverse lands. <p></p>
            We are designing this game to take the player through a variety of regions populated by various ‚ÄòBalls‚Äô. We are going with turn-based combat inspired by the likes of Heroes of Might and Magic for our combat system. Overarching that and the aforementioned regional map is an army management system, a diplomacy system and some empire-management features. We are also preparing a host of random events that can occur as the player traverses the regional maps and will be linking these events to every aspect of gameplay. <p></p>
            Now we will draw attention to the features of our game that are relatively original. We are hoping, at early access, to release most of the first campaign minus the end credits, and a surprise feature (one designed to properly cap off the first campaign). We have created a over 100 units from 21 ‚ÄòBalls' and a set of 5/6 roles. This would be something like a unit of Macedonian Light Infantry or Athenian Heavy Cavalry. This design choice lets us create an army management system that will allow the player to pick, for each battle, 8 units for their army out of a total of 110 unique units in our game (excluding commander units who have special area of effect buffs and debuffs). Now doing a little bit of math tells us that the player will theoretically have access to billions if not trillions of unique army combinations. That‚Äôs a lot to play around with, we hope. We think this would not only make for a highly replayable and somewhat historically-accurate campaign but also allow for a pretty wild multiplayer scene. <p></p>
            That's all for this dev blog!
