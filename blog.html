            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="July21Blog">Dev Blog 2: Demo Details!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">21st July 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>Hello guys! We’re back with more details of your favorite spherical conqueror! <p></p>

              The demo is incoming. The team has been putting in hard shifts to bring you our first title. As said before, the game takes the player through the various regions of the known world. Alexander and his army will conquer and live through iconic moments that have travelled down to us even in this day and age. <p></p>
              
              All this said, the demo will let the player play through the initial stages of Alexander’s conquest (there will be an accompanying post on #history-time in our Discord channel to elaborate on the time period). The opening part of the story start’s with the death of Philip the 2nd and Alexander's troubled accession to the throne. The player will explore the first 2 regions of the 17 in the Eastern/Classic campaign. This will entail beating down the tribes in the northern frontiers - PaeoniaBall, IllyriaBall and ThraceBall! After that, the player will turn south to tackle the various Greek cities. <p></p>
              
              There will be cutscenes of some of the moments that made Alexander such an enigma (one famous incident involving a certain ancient Greek philosopher will be amongst these early cutscenes). The player will be introduced to the intricacies of our battle system, the story, the objectives system, the army building and army management system and will have a couple dozen random events to experience as well. 2 of the 8 commanders under Alexander will also be deployable, alongside Alexander himself! We are hoping to include a siege battle in the demo, but I’m not sure we can promise that so early. Most likely, there will be a second version of the demo that includes a siege battle! <p></p>
              
              Thanks again for your patience. Also if anyone is interested in take part in QA testing, message us on <span class="blog3steam"><a href="https://twitter.com/RedThornInterac">Twitter</a></span>  (@RedThornInterac) or <span class="blog3steam"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RedThornInteractive/">Reddit</a></span>  (u/redthorninteractive)! <p></p>
              
              Thanks again for your patience. Your support means a lot to us and we can’t wait to get out a great game for you guys!
              </p> <p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="June22Blog">Dev Blog 1.0: Tentative Roadmap</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">5th June 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>Hello wonderful reader! <p></p>
              Welcome to our first big developer’s blog. There’s a number of things to go over. We want to let you guys know how much has been done and what is currently in the works. Once again, a quick reminder that Early Access includes a single campaign, the one that recounts the historic adventures and conquests of Alexander the Great as he conquered the Achaemenid Empire. This first campaign, and many of its underlying systems and required art and animations have kept the team busy over the last 6 months of development. Building a good turn-based combat system is quite a task and the team has done fantastically-well in this department. The design team has been slogging away at crafting the story, the 100+ random events, and the many, many tooltips that make a strategy game easily-digestible. And of course, bugs are being squashed. <p></p>
              As the title implies, we will set out a bit of a roadmap for the future of this game and its development. A beta version for testing will be our first big and holistic milestone. Then we will hope to release a demo which will allow those interested to download a concatenated version of the game and see if they like what we offer. Finally, the game will then enter early access where folks can pledge their support, play through the first campaign and enjoy multiplayer battles. Purchasers can expect further updates and free additions through the Early Access period and then expect a full version of the game with all 2 additional campaigns that explore alternative historical outcomes had Alexander chosen a different direction to undertake his conquests. <p></p>
              Our followers, well-wishers and wishlisters can expect improvements being made in every aspect of the game at all times. We do not intend to stop until the product we have on our hands gives our audience their money’s worth and also provides dozens of hours of entertainment. <br>         
              Wish us luck and please wishlist on <span class="blog3steam"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1944660/AlexanderBall_A_Countryball_Tale/">Steam!</a></span></p> <br>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="May22Blog">Dev Blog 0.3: On Steam!</h2>
            <h6 class="blogDate">11th May 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>It’s time! We’re officially up on <span class="blog3steam"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1944660/AlexanderBall_A_Countryball_Tale/">Steam!</a></span>
              Take a look around the store page, SMASH THAT WISHLIST BUTTON, and tell a friend as always! <p></p>
              The screenshots will give a great idea of how the regional maps will look. The army management tool is a big task that we’re working on but the UI design for this is ready to show. The regional map screenshots are based in the Western Asia Minor region, the third region of 17 in the first campaign. Each region is being made with as much respect for the local geography and climate as we can figure out. The regions are populated by ancient cities, temples, ruins, and villages with each having its own composition of Balls inhabiting them. Each of these ‘points of interest’ also provide the player and Alexander with Gold and Glory per month as the game progresses as well as a steady supply of troops based on the local Balls! <p></p>
              And yes, when not in a battle, the game will use a ‘real-time with pause’ feature. Much like in other grand strategy games that utilize this ‘real-time with pause’ system, Alexander and the player will face hundreds of random events throughout the game that include things like battles with bandits, dealing with scuffles within the player’s armies, random drunks, superstitious natives and much, much more! <p></p>
              The team is hard at work piecing together the first campaign’s regions, implementing UI systems, crafting amazing cutscenes, writing the story and picking out music for the game. Let us know what you guys think so far.<p></p>

            <h2 class="blogTitle" id="April22Blog">Dev Blog 0.2: Getting on Steam</h2> 
            <h6 class="blogDate">4th April 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>Hello folks! It’s been a while since our last Developer’s Blog so I figured it’s time for another update. The last blog went through some of the motivations for our game, how the units work, and also briefly mentioned some of the other features we plan on implementing. Today maybe a good time to update you guys on the progress we’ve made on many fronts for the game. Some of you may know that getting a steam store page up requires a atleast 5 screenshots and for these to be effective, all advice seems to suggest developers show as many aspects of their game as possible. For this reason, we have been polishing our battle screen, our regional map screen, and the army management UI. We’ve had a story-based cutscene drawn (which we can’t wait to reveal). We’ve finalized how are random events will look and be displayed. So these aspects of our game have had us busy in recent weeks but I’m glad to report that this period of polishing has paid off. Steam is in the process of verifying our page and we are hoping it’ll be up by the end of the week. <p></p>
            Now, I guess you guys may have noticed we haven’t shown any battles or regional screens yet. That is only because we’ve been saving stuff we can use for marketing for when the steam page is up. That way we could redirect some of the eyeballs to a steam page where hopefully some of them also wishlist our game. We’re very excited to showcase all our hard work as much as some of you guys are excited to see it. The time for that is tantalizingly close. <p></p>
            Stay tuned folks!
            </p> <br>

            
            <h2 class="blogTitle">Dev Blog 0.1: Hello World! </h2> 
            <h6 class="blogDate">17th April 2022</h6> <br>
            <p>
            Today marks the first Dev Blog about Red Thorn Interactive’s first game AlexanderBall: A Countryball Tale. <br><br>
            This game is inspired by a love of history and the way the Countryball/Polandball community represents complex topics through light, digestible aesthetics. In keeping with this spirit, our game hopes to tell the story of Alexander the Great and his conquests over diverse lands. <p></p>
            We are designing this game to take the player through a variety of regions populated by various ‘Balls’. We are going with turn-based combat inspired by the likes of Heroes of Might and Magic for our combat system. Overarching that and the aforementioned regional map is an army management system, a diplomacy system and some empire-management features. We are also preparing a host of random events that can occur as the player traverses the regional maps and will be linking these events to every aspect of gameplay. <p></p>
            Now we will draw attention to the features of our game that are relatively original. We are hoping, at early access, to release most of the first campaign minus the end credits, and a surprise feature (one designed to properly cap off the first campaign). We have created a over 100 units from 21 ‘Balls' and a set of 5/6 roles. This would be something like a unit of Macedonian Light Infantry or Athenian Heavy Cavalry. This design choice lets us create an army management system that will allow the player to pick, for each battle, 8 units for their army out of a total of 110 unique units in our game (excluding commander units who have special area of effect buffs and debuffs). Now doing a little bit of math tells us that the player will theoretically have access to billions if not trillions of unique army combinations. That’s a lot to play around with, we hope. We think this would not only make for a highly replayable and somewhat historically-accurate campaign but also allow for a pretty wild multiplayer scene. <p></p>
            That's all for this dev blog!
