    </p>

      <h2 class="faqSubHead">THE HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
      <p class="questions">Q. Why the story of Alexander the Great?</p>

      <p class="questions">Q. Is this game historically accurate?</p>
      A. We are trying our best. The dizzying volume of individuals that are named in the historical sources depicting this time period are not captured in this game because we believe it simply cannot be fully captured within a video game, especially not a video game by a studio of our size. Nonetheless, extensive historical research has gone into the game. All decisions are a product of the balancing act between fun game design and historical accuracy. <p></p>

      <p class="questions">Q. What time period is the game based in?</p>
      A. The game starts at 336 BC. <p></p>

      A. Yes. <p></p>
      
      <p class="questions">Q. Will the game support simultaneous turns on multiplayer?</p>
