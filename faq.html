      <h2 style="font-family:Evil Empire; font-size: 2vw; color: #B3172F;">THE HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
      Q. Why the story of Alexander the Great? <br>
      A. The diversity in his army can be very well represented through the colorful Countryball art style and allows room for an interesting reexamination of the short-lived Macedonian Empire. <p></p>

      Q. Is this game historically accurate? <br>
      A. We are trying our best. The dizzying volume of individuals that are named in the historical sources depicting this time period are not captured in this game because we believe it simply cannot be fully captured within a video game, especially not a video game by a studio of our size. Nonetheless, extensive historical research has gone into the game. All decisions are a product of the balancing act between fun game design and historical accuracy. <p></p>
